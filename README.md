# diabebes-angular-ts
Repo I made to briefly [Max's Udemy Course on Angular 6 with TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2)
* Plan to follow through for the learning of best-practices & convention w Angular & ts

### Initial thoughts
* **angular-cli is awesome**
    * `ng g c ${componentName}` is super-powerful: streamlines workflow, sets up test-suite, unique stylesheet
* **really enjoy the way everything looks & feels *separated***
    * while the directory is slightly more messy than a simple react-app, everything feels nicely segregated into specific parts: stylesheets split-up, testing
* **dealing with natural-HTML is really refreshing**
    * coming from using JSX which can get messy sometimes; especially with syntactical issues from ES6 & Babel <6 not co-operating sometimes
