# angular-ts
Repo I made to run-through [Max's Udemy Course on Angular 6 with TypeScript](google.com)

Plan to follow through for the learning of best-practices & convention w Angular & ts -- but will also look to use these concepts practically

### Initial thoughts
* angular-cli is awesome
    * `ng g c ${componentName}` is super-powerful: streamlines workflow, sets up test-suite, unique stylesheet
* really enjoy the way everything looks & feels *separated*
    * while the directory is slightly more messy than a simple react-app, everything feels nicely segregated into specific parts: stylesheets split-up, testing
* dealing with natural-HTML is really refreshing
    * coming from using JSX which can get messy sometimes; especially with syntactical issues from ES6 & Babel <6 not co-operating sometimes
